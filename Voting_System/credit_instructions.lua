-//Here is a Voting System which you can implement into your game.

1. Take All the Values inside of the Remotes Folder and place them in Replicated Storage

2. Place the CountdownUI inside of StarterGui

3. The Map Locations within the Maps Folder can be altered for the maps in your game

4. You can obviously leave the Voing System model in the Workspace


5. This Voting Script was intially tested before release so the start Part within

the CountDown folder was used to initlize the countdown you can make alterations to this in

the voting Script so it can work with your game.

A majority of the Voting System resides in the Voting Server Script 

Look To the Script within the Code Folder to further see how to alter it to your game.

It will have the Customize Tag like the one above

I hope this resoruce was helpful to beginner scripters learning about Lua and Roblox Themselves
